## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.


Cross Strokes - Phoebe Oliff


I used photos I took this year in January while visiting my family in the South Island, which mostly consisted of nature photography. After looking at example precedents from class, I decided I wanted to try recreate some classic painting/drawing techniques to see how the program would interpret and display them and how natural or unatural I could make the 'strokes' look.

I initially started using a collection of photos of ducks in a lake, but I decided after experimenting with pixel treatment that it did not look very distingushable for the artistic look I was after. I chose a selection of photos of my dad and our dog on the beach so I could experiment with the figures, and the bright reflections on the sand and water started to become bolder with my treatments so I decided on these as my final images. 

I experimented with coding different shapes to see what could recreate a classic impressionism painting, this proved to be difficult as I was not wrapping my head around layering to get the natural arcs and crosses I wanted. After futher research, I had the idea to turn to a cross-hatch technique as it was used by artists and craftsmen to create the effect of blending on harder surfaces such as wood carving. I also experimented with the texture layer overlay shown in class by using a jackson pollock painting, but I did not like the look of the outcome so I went back to only working with the original image. 

I found the AI training interesting as my masks turned out quite deatiled and possibly more so than my initial masks created in photoshop. I added in a photo of just my dog on the beach to see if it would still detect his sillouette and it turned out amazing. 

For my final pixel treatment, I replicated a simple cross-hatch using two intersecting lines outside of my mask as I found having both the figures in the mask and the background having the same treatment was very visually crowded and overwhelming. I used thin lines for the pixels inside the mask to replicate broad strokes diagonally across the figure which creates a rich blend of the colours but still stands out from the noise in the background. 

If I had more time, I would have loved to experiment more with an extra treatment for the drop shadows of the figures and experimented more with the RGB values to get more saturated colour from the images. I would have also loved to apply more accesibility principles to the treatment and look more into that as that is somehting I want to practice in my work more especially as I enter my last year. 

Overall considering the setbacks and my inexperience with coding, I feel proud of my final work and have enjoyed learning more about different methods and uses of p5.js. I am excited to continue making and learning more with everything I've learn't this trimester.
